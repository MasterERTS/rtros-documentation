## Bringing Real-Time Capabilities to ROS

__ROS__ *(Robot Operating System)* is a software environment *(i.e., middleware)* providing a set of tools to connect multiple parts of a robotic setup. It offers nice features to interface with a wide range of sensors and actuators. However, it does not natively provide any strict real-time guarantees. Yet, many modern-day robots have a strong need to achieve a deterministic, time-bounded behaviour *(e.g., mobile robot collision avoidance)*.

The aim of the project is to determine  how real-time capabilities can be brought to ROS. The first step would be to identify the existing real-time extensions, and carry out a comparative study about each of them. The next step would be to setup the installation process for a real-time environment using ROS and Linux/Xenomai. The final step will consist in developing and testing real-time ROS nodes.

### Existing Real-Time Extensions for ROS:
This is heading 1, this is just to check if things are working or not

---

### Configuration of a System to run ROS + Linux/Xenomai:

This is another heading, to verify whether this is all working.

---

### Developing an application using real-time ROS Nodes:

This is also a test phrase. To be removed later.
