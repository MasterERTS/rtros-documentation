Xenomai is a real-time OS using Linux as a background task. Linux is preempted as a simple task. With Xenomai, the idea of impossible preemption, handlers, is no longer valid. Tasks, handled by Xenomai, are guaranteed to have a hard real-time execution.

But running two Operating Systems has its load of issues. First you need two schedulers, which leads to issues again : how to share the hardware, how to make Xenomai's and Linux's tasks interact with each other.

As beginers ourselves, we will try to popularize what we can fetch from challenging tutorials and technical data about Xenomai.
