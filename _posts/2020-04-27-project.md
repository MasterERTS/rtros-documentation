<div style="text-align: justify">
<b>ROS</b> (Robot Operating System) is a software environment (i.e., middleware) providing a set of tools to connect multiple parts of a robotic setup. It offers nice features to interface with a wide range of sensors and actuators. However, it does not natively provide any strict real-time guarantees. Yet, many modern-day robots have a strong need to achieve a deterministic, time-bounded behaviour (e.g., mobile robot collision avoidance).
<br>
<br>
The aim of the project is to determine how real-time capabilities can be brought to ROS. The first step would be to identify the existing real-time extensions, and carry out a comparative study about each of them. The next step would be to setup the installation process for a real-time environment using ROS and Linux/Xenomai. The final step will consist in developing and testing real-time ROS nodes.

## A self-explanatory example

## What's hard real-time computing ?

- It's about determinism, not performance.
- Correct computation delivered at the correct time
- Failure to respond is as bad as a wrong response

## Requirements

We need an OS able to deliver the determinism we need. For Linux variants, the Linux kernel itself is NOT real time and has a max latency of 10^4 µs. RT PREEMPT is a soft real-time OS and has a max latency between 10 and 100 µs. The later will be the one we use, as **Xenomai** is hard real-time and has a max latency of **10 µs**.
