Congratulations, you have now successfully configured ROS for your target system. It's time to get to know the fundamental features of ROS. We will take a look at two main styles of development in ROS - we can either write everything from scratch, which for a small application is doable, but defeats the purpose of using ROS when we apply this for a large(complex) system. The second approach is going to be reusing some existing code found on the internet, and making it usable for our task.

### Creating from scratch - The "chatter" application

The *chatter* is almost like the "Hello World" of the ROS universe. It is the most basic application we can have that makes use of the capabilities of ROS. It will be a very simple application, which will make use of ros messages to communicate over a ros topic using ros nodes. These need to be defined first:

* A **ROS node** is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes in a network. For our purpose, we can look at it just like a simple executable.

* A **ROS topic** is the data channel through which the ROS nodes communicate with each other.

* A **ROS message** defines the type of data that is flowing through the channel.

Now that these definitions are in place, we would want to go ahead and implement a simple Publisher-Subscriber application. There will be two nodes, conveniently named "publish" and "subscribe", which will exchange a string message over a topic called "/chatter". The graph for the application can be seen below:

**NOTE:** This tutorial is going to be a gross oversimplication of creating a simple ROS application, as the explanations of core ROS functionalities is beyond the scope. For a detailed tutorial with individual focus on each module, we invite you to check out the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).

We navigate to the src directory of our catkin workspace that we had created after the ROS installation. It is located in `~/ros/src` for the purpose of the tutorial. There we have to build a package, which is facilitated by using `catkin_create_pkg` utility. The standard format for creating a catking package using this tool is:
```sh
catkin_create_pkg <name_of_package> <depends1> <depends2> ... <dependsn>
```
So here we see that we have to specify the name of the package and add the names of other packages that our package depends on. Let us call our package "chatter" and since we will only be sending a string message, we know that our package will depend on the std_msgs package. Also, we will need the roscpp and the rospy dependencies.

So, the command we should type in our terminal should be as follows:

```sh
cd ~/ros/src
catkin_create_pkg chatter std_msgs roscpp rospy
catkin build && exit
```
So we have generated and built our package, now it is time to put some data in it. Open up a new terminal and navigate to your ROS package using roscd. Using roscd allows you to directly navigate to the src directory of the package. In order to cd into our chatter package, we will type `roscd chatter`. Use the Tab key to autocomplete and also check if it is properly configured or not.

Now we will store all the source files in the src directory. We will create two files, a `publisher.cpp` and a `subscriber.py` file, just to illustrate the ROS development policy.

```sh
roscd chatter
cd src
touch publisher.cpp
touch subscriber.py
```
Using the above commands, we have navigated to the src directory in the package, then created two empty files.
