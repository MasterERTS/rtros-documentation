## Overview

## Motivation

## A self-explanatory example

## What's hard real-time computing ?

* It's about determinism, not performance.
* Correct computation delivered at the correct time
* Failure to respond is as bad as a wrong response

## Requirements

We need an OS able to deliver the determinism we need. For Linux variants, the Linux kernel itself is NOT real time and has a max latency of 10^4 µs. RT PREEMPT is a soft real-time OS and has a max latency between 10 and 100 µs. The later will be the one we use, as **Xenomai** is hard real-time and has a max latency of **10 µs**.
